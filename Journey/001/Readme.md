# Jumped Into YouTube AWS Lab

## Cloud Research

Some AWS firsts today when following along with this [AWS Lab video](https://youtu.be/uo_Xf_pGTvg)

 -Created AWS account w/MFA
 -Setup CloudWatch alert for billing (Face with tears of joy)
 -Created VPC/Internet Gateway/Subnets
 -Created Security Group
 -Spun up a Windows/Linux EC2 instance w/keys

I wanted to try all these out but I feel I need a bit more guidance on my learning path to make sure I get a good foundation of infomration. So tomorrow I'm going to pick a training class with labs...
