# AWS CCP Class Test Practice Exams

## Cloud Research

Took multiple practice tests on the ExamPro website for the CCP. I did this over the course of 5 days in preparation for the CCP exam. I scored 80+% on all exams the first time through. I like the way these exams are laid out, as they only have you go back through the quesitons you failed when you retake the exam. 

I also did a live stream on my YouTube channel of the newest practice exam withthe program which was updated to reflect a change in some of the topics covered on the updated CCP exam.
