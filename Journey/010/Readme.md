# AWS SysOps Admin Associate Class Day 1

After trying to decide which AWS path I want to take next with the end goal of getting the Advanced Networking and Security specialization certs, I've decided to go with SysOps Admin Associate. In doing research and talking to some other folks this is more technical than the Solutions Architect Associate and should set up nicely for those other two certs.

Since I enjoyed the CCP program at ExamPro, I bought their associate certs bundle (all 3 associate cert training classes, it was about $40 for all 3 classes). I'm looking forward to more labs.

I did start the next class and did an overview of the cert and started to get a more indepth into CloudWatch and the different types of logs, streams, and log groups available.
